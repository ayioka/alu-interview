# Rain Trap Calculator

This Python module provides a function `rain` to calculate the total amount of water trapped between walls.

## Usage

```python
from rain import rain

walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
water_trapped = rain(walls)
print("Total trapped water:", water_trapped)
Function Signature
python
Copy code
def rain(walls: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the total trapped water between walls.

    Args:
    walls (list): List of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

    Returns:
    int: Total trapped water.
    """
Arguments
walls (list): List of non-negative integers representing the heights of the walls.
Returns
int: Total trapped water.
Algorithm
The function iterates over each element in the walls list except the first and last elements, representing the left and right boundaries. For each element, it calculates the maximum height of walls to its left and right, then determines the minimum boundary height. If the minimum boundary height is greater than the height of the current wall, it calculates the amount of water trapped above the current wall. Finally, it returns the total trapped water.

Example
Given walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1], the function returns 6, indicating a total of 6 units of water can be trapped between the walls.
